    TrainingArguments is the subset of the arguments we use in our example scripts **which relate to the training loop
    itself**.

    Using :class:`~transformers.HfArgumentParser` we can turn this class into `argparse
    <https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse>`__ arguments that can be specified on the command
    line.

    Parameters:
        output_dir (:obj:`str`):
            The output directory where the model predictions and checkpoints will be written.
        overwrite_output_dir (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            If :obj:`True`, overwrite the content of the output directory. Use this to continue training if
            :obj:`output_dir` points to a checkpoint directory.
        do_train (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to run training or not. This argument is not directly used by :class:`~transformers.Trainer`, it's

            <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more details.
        do_eval (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether to run evaluation on the validation set or not. Will be set to :obj:`True` if
            :obj:`evaluation_strategy` is different from :obj:`"no"`. This argument is not directly used by
            :class:`~transformers.Trainer`, it's intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See
            the `example scripts <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more
            details.
        do_predict (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to run predictions on the test set or not. This argument is not directly used by

                logging, evaluation, save will be conducted every ``gradient_accumulation_steps * xxx_step`` training
                examples.
        eval_accumulation_steps (:obj:`int`, `optional`):
            Number of predictions steps to accumulate the output tensors for, before moving the results to the CPU. If

        log_level (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to ``passive``):
            Logger log level to use on the main process. Possible choices are the log levels as strings: 'debug',
            'info', 'warning', 'error' and 'critical', plus a 'passive' level which doesn't set anything and lets the
            application set the level.

            This should not be activated when the different nodes use the same storage as the files will be saved with
            the same names for each node.
        no_cuda (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to not use CUDA even when it is available or not.
        seed (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to 42):
            Random seed that will be set at the beginning of training. To ensure reproducibility across runs, use the
            :func:`~transformers.Trainer.model_init` function to instantiate the model if it has some randomly
            initialized parameters.

            The backend to use for mixed precision training. Must be one of :obj:`"auto"`, :obj:`"amp"` or
            :obj:`"apex"`. :obj:`"auto"` will use AMP or APEX depending on the PyTorch version detected, while the
            other choices will force the requested backend.
        fp16_full_eval (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to use full 16-bit precision evaluation instead of 32-bit. This will be faster and save memory but
            can harm metric values.

            Rank of the process during distributed training.
        tpu_num_cores (:obj:`int`, `optional`):

            same value as :obj:`logging_steps` if not set.
        dataloader_num_workers (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to 0):
            Number of subprocesses to use for data loading (PyTorch only). 0 means that the data will be loaded in the
            main process.
        past_index (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to -1):
            Some models like :doc:`TransformerXL <../model_doc/transformerxl>` or :doc:`XLNet <../model_doc/xlnet>` can
            make use of the past hidden states for their predictions. If this argument is set to a positive int, the
            ``Trainer`` will use the corresponding output (usually index 2) as the past state and feed it to the model
            at the next training step under the keyword argument ``mems``.
        run_name (:obj:`str`, `optional`):
            A descriptor for the run. Typically used for `wandb <https://www.wandb.com/>`_ logging.

            If using :obj:`datasets.Dataset` datasets, whether or not to automatically remove the columns unused by the
            model forward method.

            (Note that this behavior is not implemented for :class:`~transformers.TFTrainer` yet.)
        label_names (:obj:`List[str]`, `optional`):
            The list of keys in your dictionary of inputs that correspond to the labels.

            Will eventually default to :obj:`["labels"]` except if the model used is one of the
            :obj:`XxxForQuestionAnswering` in which case it will default to :obj:`["start_positions",
            "end_positions"]`.
        load_best_model_at_end (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to load the best model found during training at the end of training.

            .. note::

        metric_for_best_model (:obj:`str`, `optional`):
            Use in conjunction with :obj:`load_best_model_at_end` to specify the metric to use to compare two different
            models. Must be the name of a metric returned by the evaluation with or without the prefix :obj:`"eval_"`.
            Will default to :obj:`"loss"` if unspecified and :obj:`load_best_model_at_end=True` (to use the evaluation
            loss).

            If you set this value, :obj:`greater_is_better` will default to :obj:`True`. Don't forget to set it to
            :obj:`False` if your metric is better when lower.
        greater_is_better (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Use in conjunction with :obj:`load_best_model_at_end` and :obj:`metric_for_best_model` to specify if better
            models should have a greater metric or not. Will default to:

            - :obj:`True` if :obj:`metric_for_best_model` is set to a value that isn't :obj:`"loss"` or

            When resuming training, whether or not to skip the epochs and batches to get the data loading at the same
            stage as in the previous training. If set to :obj:`True`, the training will begin faster (as that skipping
            step can take a long time) but will not yield the same results as the interrupted training would have.
        sharded_ddp (:obj:`bool`, :obj:`str` or list of :class:`~transformers.trainer_utils.ShardedDDPOption`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Use Sharded DDP training from `FairScale <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale>`__ (in distributed
            training only). This is an experimental feature.

            A list of options along the following:

            - :obj:`"simple"`: to use first instance of sharded DDP released by fairscale (:obj:`ShardedDDP`) similar

              (:obj:`FullyShardedDDP`) in Zero-2 mode (with :obj:`reshard_after_forward=False`).
            - :obj:`"zero_dp_3"`: to use the second instance of sharded DPP released by fairscale
              (:obj:`FullyShardedDDP`) in Zero-3 mode (with :obj:`reshard_after_forward=True`).
            - :obj:`"offload"`: to add ZeRO-offload (only compatible with :obj:`"zero_dp_2"` and :obj:`"zero_dp_3"`).

            If a string is passed, it will be split on space. If a bool is passed, it will be converted to an empty
            list for :obj:`False` and :obj:`["simple"]` for :obj:`True`.
        deepspeed (:obj:`str` or :obj:`dict`, `optional`):
            Use `Deepspeed <https://github.com/microsoft/deepspeed>`__. This is an experimental feature and its API may
            evolve in the future. The value is either the location of DeepSpeed json config file (e.g.,
            ``ds_config.json``) or an already loaded json file as a :obj:`dict`"
        label_smoothing_factor (:obj:`float`, `optional`, defaults to 0.0):
            The label smoothing factor to use. Zero means no label smoothing, otherwise the underlying onehot-encoded
            labels are changed from 0s and 1s to :obj:`label_smoothing_factor/num_labels` and :obj:`1 -
            label_smoothing_factor + label_smoothing_factor/num_labels` respectively.
        debug (:obj:`str` or list of :class:`~transformers.debug_utils.DebugOption`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`""`):
            Enable one or more debug features. This is an experimental feature.

            Possible options are:

            - :obj:`"underflow_overflow"`: detects overflow in model's input/outputs and reports the last frames that
              led to the event
            - :obj:`"tpu_metrics_debug"`: print debug metrics on TPU

            The options should be separated by whitespaces.
        adafactor (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to use the :class:`~transformers.Adafactor` optimizer instead of

        length_column_name (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"length"`):
            Column name for precomputed lengths. If the column exists, grouping by length will use these values rather
            than computing them on train startup. Ignored unless :obj:`group_by_length` is :obj:`True` and the dataset
            is an instance of :obj:`Dataset`.
        report_to (:obj:`str` or :obj:`List[str]`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"all"`):
            The list of integrations to report the results and logs to. Supported platforms are :obj:`"azure_ml"`,

            down the training and evaluation speed.
        push_to_hub (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to upload the trained model to the hub after training. If this is activated, and
